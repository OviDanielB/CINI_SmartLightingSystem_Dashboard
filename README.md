# Dashboard for [HELIOS](https://github.com/OviDanielB/CINI_SmartLightingSystem) System
This repository contains a [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) dashboard (both server side and client side) for **[HELIOS](https://github.com/OviDanielB/CINI_SmartLightingSystem)**.
The server side is a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) app using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) Framework which listens on a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) queue for messages sent from
the HELIOS System, stores the in [Redis](https://redis.io/) and responds to AJAX calls from the Angular app on the client.The dashboard 
illustrates information on HELIOS such as:
* Lamp count (total, working, with anomalies)
* Total streets count
* Lamps not working correctly with relative anomaly type, position and lamp model (in case substitution is needed)
* Individual lamp consumption statistics over different periods (last hour, day and week)
* Streets consumption statistics over different periods (last hour, day and week)
* Global (entire city) consumption statistics over different periods (last hour, day and week) presented on 3 different charts

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
The following software must be present to install the System and the related links shows how to install them:
###### Back-End
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package manager for JavaScript and the worldâ€™s largest software registry


###### Front-End
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - A JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework for developing single page applications.
* [Bower](https://bower.io/) - A package manager for the web.
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - An open-source JavaScript toolkit used as a streaming build system in front-end web development.


### Project Structure
Main project structure with relevant content only.
```
Dashboard
   |--bower_components (javascript libraries for front-end)
   |--css (css files)
   |--dist (present only after building for distribution with gulp, main dir for 
   .        serving static web content)
   .
   |--js (Angular controllers)
   .
   .
   |--server (nodejs back-end modules like rabbit,redis connections,etc)
        |--config (configuration file)
        |--const (predefined constants like routing keys,cache saving keys)
        |--cache.js (main Redis insertion and retrieval module, used to respond
        .            to AJAX calls with specific queries)
        |--globalStat.js (stores and updates global consumption statistics)
        |--lampStatistics.js (stores and updates individual and aggregates of lamps 
        .                     consumption statistics )
        |--rabbit.js (connects to rabbit queue and passes messages to cache)    
        |--utils.js (utilities)
   |--views (static HTML files)
   |--bower.json (front-end packages definition)
   |--gulpfile.js (building system instructions)
   |--index.html (main HTML page)
   .
   |--server.js (nodeJS app for back-end)

```

### Configuration
Configuration file can be found in *./server/config/config.js* and the following 
default connection parameters can be modified:

```
{
    REDIS_HOST: "localhost",
    REDIS_PORT: 6379,
    RABBIT_HOST: "amqp://localhost:5673",
    RABBIT_QUEUE_NAME: "dashboard",
    RABBIT_EXCHANGE_NAME: "dashboard_exchange"
}
```

### Web Page Building
First, download front-end JavaScript libraries and frameworks (AngularJS, CharJS) from the 
*bower.json* package file with
 ```
 bower install
 ```
 and a *bower_components* directory will be created with the relative JS files.
In the present state, the dashboard can't be served as a single web page. However you can start a 
web server offered by gulp by typing
 ```
 gulp serve
 ```
in the root project directory.This way, any change to any of the files of the dashboard are immediatly 
available on the browser at *localhost:3000*.
 If you want to build the entire web page and serve as any static content by any web server (in this case
 a NodeJS one) type
 ```
 gulp build:dist
 ```
 which will create (or overwrite if already present) a *dist* directory in which all the static content 
 will be present.
 
 ### Rabbit and Redis
 Before starting the NodeJS app ensure you have on the local machine a RabbitMQ queue
  listening on port 5673 and a Redis server on port 6379. If you don't start the relative Docker containers with 
  the ports open
   ```
   docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
   docker run -d --name rabbit_dashboard -p 5673:5672 -p 15673:15672 rabbitmq:alpine
   ```
   
  Use the alpine versions because they are light-weighted than the original versions because run on a 
  simplified and basic distribution of Linux.
 
 ### Node Start
 To start the server, you first need to install all node depencies with
  ```
  npm install 
 ```
 which will create the  *node_component* directory.
 Then, in the root project directory type
  ```
  node server.js
 ```
and the node app will start listening on *localhost:8080* so the web page is available at that URL.
